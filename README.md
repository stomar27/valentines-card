# ❤️ My Interactive Valentine's Card

A fun website where I ask my Valentine special questions! (Spoiler: They can't say No).

## 🚀 How to make this website LIVE

If you are new to coding, don't worry! Follow these 3 steps:

### 1. Upload to GitHub
1. Create an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com).
2. Create a new "Repository" named `valentines-card`.
3. Upload all these files into that repository.

### 2. Connect to Vercel
1. Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with your GitHub account.
2. Click **Add New Project** and select your `valentines-card` repo.

### 3. Add the AI Key
1. Before clicking "Deploy", find the **Environment Variables** section.
2. Add a variable with Name: `API_KEY`.
3. Put your Google Gemini API Key in the Value field.
4. Click **DEPLOY**!

Vercel will give you a link (like `valentines-card.vercel.app`) to send to your Valentine!

## ✨ Features
- **Slippery No Button**: The "No" button runs away when they try to click it.
- **Growing Yes Button**: The more they try to say No, the bigger the "Yes" gets!
- **AI Sweet Talk**: Uses Google Gemini to write cute romantic messages every time they click "Yes".
